The Allagash story, however, has roots that go much further back then the ten years the Portland, Maine brewery has been in operation. The roots go into the early 1990's when founder Rob Tod saw something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels, Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public. He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales. Allagash began with the release of its Allagash White, modeled after the traditional White beers of Belgium. Also referred to as wit beers, they get their unique flavor from the use of wheat in place of barley, Curacao orange peel and the careful sprinkling of coriander and other spices. Allagash combined these ingredients with their very own proprietary Belgian yeast strain to create the remarkably unique and refreshing beer that is today their flagship brand. Allagash White developed a strong cult following around the Portland area where it was available at selected draft accounts. Due to its immediate success, the beer was soon made available in 12-ounce six-packs throughout the state of Maine. With the success of the first brand, Rob realized two things: The public was asking for some new styles and the workload was getting to be too much for one person. Soon after, two experienced brewers were hired and Allagash released their second brew, Allagash Double Ale. Using the philosophy and techniques created by the Trappist Monks of Belgium centuries ago, the staff created this beer using seven different malts, a traditional sugar, and their own Belgian yeast strain. The result was another unique yet balanced beer crafted in the classic Belgian style. To truly appreciate the classic styles and brewing traditions of Belgium, one must experience beer created in the classic Belgian package. This is why Allagash, after an extensive period of research, released their distinctive Reserve line of cork finished 750 ML bottles. This unique line employs the ancient tradition referred to as the m\u00c3\u00a9thode champenoise. The technique calls for two fermentations, one in the Brewery's fermenting tanks and the second in the bottle itself. It is this second fermentation that produces a notable increase in carbonation, a softer mouthfeel, and beers of remarkable complexity. This method of bottle conditioning leaves a small amount of yeast in the bottle, creating what is known as a living beer. As a result, these styles have a greatly enhanced shelf life and some styles will age exceptionally, much like a fine wine. Just as the styles originate in Belgium, so does the package itself. To insure authenticity, Allagash imports the bottles and corks directly from the same country that designed the techniques. This enables the beers to reach carbonation levels similar to champagne while allowing the corks to pop characteristically upon serving. Today, Allagash still remains one of very few breweries in North America using this distinctive package. From the very beginning, Allagash has strived to produce the finest Belgian-style and experimental ales this side of the Atlantic. It began as New England's original Belgian-Style brewery and has grown into one of the industry's most distinguished and well-respected brands. Following the time-tested brewing traditions of ancient Belgium, Allagash now produces a broad-ranging portfolio of artisanal beers with uncompromising quality.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","beers":[{"id":1021,"brewery_id":23,"name":"Four","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":10,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"},{"id":1034,"brewery_id":23,"name":"Grand Cru","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":7.2,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"},{"id":1424,"brewery_id":23,"name":"Tripel Reserve","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":9,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"},{"id":1438,"brewery_id":23,"name":"Speciale Reserve Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"},{"id":2015,"brewery_id":23,"name":"Double Ale","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"},{"id":4282,"brewery_id":23,"name":"Allagash White","cat_id":5,"style_id":67,"abv":5,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"Our interpretation of a traditional Belgian wheat beer, Allagash White is unique and truly refreshing.

From start to finish, he is a one-man operation. The former cabinetmaker is also a self-reliant Mainer through and through. He was originally an all-grain homebrewer who decided to take it to the next level when his friends expressed interest in his beers. He designed the 12-barrel brewing system himself and enlisted a local welder to help put it together. Hazen notes that when you live in Maine, you have to find some service to provide to others in order to survive. For him, brewing is the service he provides to his local community. Located in the rolling hills of Lincolnville, Maine, Andrew's is housed in a renovated farmhouse next to Hazen's home. Finding the brewery is more than half the battle. Have no fear, however, as everyone knows about Andrew's. Also, be aware that due to some thieving souls, the brewery no longer has any signage to announce its existence to the visiting public. The only indication that a brewery exists in the farmhouse are the occasional keg deliveries in Hazen's front yard. And Hazen hasn't been quick to replace the sign either. While he welcomes visitors, you have to remember to clear a path for the busy brewer. Like many other unsung small brewers, running his 5OO-barrel per year brewery is a seven day a week operation for Hazen. Watching Hazen run the brewery is a little like watching Willy Wonka run the Chocolate Factory. When I visit him during a bottling day, Hazen runs between the bottling line and the packaging supplies in a hurried yet methodical manner. He stands up bottles on the line, starts the machine, slides his way across the brewhouse to the packaging materials, and hand assembles the six-packs that will hold the soon-to-be bottled beer. Andrew's beer is straightforward, unassuming and entirely enjoyable. His product line includes the St. Nick Porter, the Northern Brown Ale, the English Pale Ale, and the summer seasonal Ruby's Golden Ale. A celebration of the Amarillo hop, Hazen's English Pale Ale is a delightfully balanced product that neither over or underwhelms the palate.  from beerscribe.com","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","beers":[],"geocode":{"id":40,"brewery_id":42,"latitude":44.3516,"longitude":-69.1401,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"}},{"id":43,"name":"Angelic Brewing","address1":"","address2":"","city":"Madison","state":"Wisconsin","code":"53703","country":"United States","phone":"1-608-257-2707","website":"","filepath":"","descript":"(No longer brewing)","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","beers":[{"id":2837,"brewery_id":43,"name":"London Porter","cat_id":2,"style_id":25,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"},{"id":2838,"brewery_id":43,"name":"Shakedown Nut Brown","cat_id":3,"style_id":38,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"},{"id":2839,"brewery_id":43,"name":"Bacchanal Blonde","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}],"geocode":{"id":41,"brewery_id":43,"latitude":43.0785,"longitude":-89.382,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"}},{"id":44,"name":"Anheuser-Busch","address1":"One Busch Place","address2":"","city":"Saint Louis","state":"Missouri","code":"63118","country":"United States","phone":"1-800-342-5283","website":"http:\/\/www.anheuser-busch.com\/","filepath":"","descript":"Anheuser-Busch operates 12 breweries in the United States, 14 in China and one in the United Kingdom.

Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.\r\n\r\nAmerican home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.\r\n\r\nBig Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.

In England most of the beer is some kind of \"bitter\".  Bitter is a style that became popular in the late 1800's. The most famous examples are brewed in Burton on Trent.  This hard water gives these beer a pleasantly dry bitter finish, hence the name \"bitter.\"  A brewery usually brews several bitters of various alcohol strengths.  The lowest in alcohol (and usually flavor) is called \"bitter\" or \"ordinary bitter.\"  A step up in alcohol and hop character gives us \"best bitter\" or \"special bitter.\"  Finally a beer is made that is full of hop aroma and flavor, has a maltiness to match, and a generous amount of alcohol is called an \"extra special bitter\" or E.S.B.\r\n\r\nAlthough inspired by the British Ales  Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale uses distinctive American hops, which give not only the crisp bitterness to balance the malt, but also a hint of floral aroma. We brew Calico Amber Ale with 100% malt and use 4 different malts to give it a rich complexity.  The blend of crystal  malts give it flavors including toffee and caramel.  A blend of American Cascade and Centennial hops provide a counterpoint to the malt.  Finally our proprietary yeast provides a fruity background and a Madeira like richness that rounds out this gold medal winning ale.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"},{"id":5134,"brewery_id":68,"name":"Black Marlin Porter","cat_id":2,"style_id":25,"abv":6,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter is a rich dark chocolaty Porter with a distinctive American hop character.

Flaked unmalted wheat, oats and malted barley comprise the grain. The unmalted wheat has a high protein content, which causes the beer to be hazy, thus giving it a cloudy, or \"white\" appearance. A special yeast gives a refreshing tangy flavor that is different from both the sour Weiss beers of Berlin or the banana and clovey Weizens of Bavaria. The mild hopping allows the unique malts to show through and does not conflict with the subtleties of the citrus spicing. This unique citrus character is created by adding a blend of curacao (bitter orange), sweet orange and coriander to the boil.

Thank you for embracing our fiercely independent vision of a hand-crafted future for all! Operating as a brewpub from August 1995 until February 2005, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company recently relocated to our current location in the West End of downtown Cincinnati. We officially reopened with a completed expansion plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals 31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently flavorful product. While our brewing process is quite labor intensive, we believe that hand-crafting our beers sets us apart from the majority of breweries in the U.S. today.

Though a native of South Williamsport, Barbarian Chief, Mike Hiller, first entered the craft brewing industry in 1997 as an Account Services Associate for Legendary Distributors, Ltd., of Richmond, Virginia. After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife, Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the recipes for Hammerin' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment's balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian's logo and label designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business plans. Thanks to the support of family, friends and other area businessmen who believed in Mike's dream, Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is now a reality.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","beers":[{"id":4123,"brewery_id":87,"name":"Hammerin' Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":33,"abv":4.5,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"Hammerin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Ale is the Barbarian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first beer.
